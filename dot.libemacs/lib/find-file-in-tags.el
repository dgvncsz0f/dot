;; Installation:
;; Add a binding to the main function, then use it:
;;   (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro "C-,") 'find-file-in-tags)
;;
;; When you call 'find-file-in-tags, you'll be prompted for a file name.
;; If more than one file matches what you've typed, you're offered to
;; refine your choice - this time using the full paths to the files.
;;
;; This routine also takes into account multiple work areas for the same project.
;; Let's say you have a project which has the files
;;      myproject/file.c
;;      myproject/file.h
;;
;; And you've checked out two work areas
;; ~/work/monday_version/TAGS
;; ~/work/monday_version/file.c
;; ~/work/monday_version/file.h
;; ~/work/monday_version/subdir/helper.h
;;
;; ~/work/thursday_version/TAGS
;; ~/work/thursday_version/file.c
;; ~/work/thursday_version/file.h
;; ~/work/thursday_version/subdir/helper.h
;;
;; When you invoke 'find-file-in-tags in the buffer file.c (in monday_version)
;; the file you open up will be found in ~/work/monday_version, e.g.
;;     M-x find-file-in-tags helper.h RET
;; will open up ~/work/monday_version/subdir/helper.h
;; 
;; If you you were visiting file.c in thursday_version, the helper.h opened
;; would be the one in thursday_version
;;
;; And this just uses a single TAGS file.
;;
;; Limitations: the code checks to ensure that TAGS files exist in both locations.
;; AND
;; It currently assumes that the work areas are all rooted in the same directory.
;; i.e. work areas in the following directories would function properly 
;;    ~/work1 ~/work2 ~/some_other_work_directory_name
;; these would fail
;;    ~/work1 ~/subdir/work2 /tmp/work3
;;
;;
;; TODO: make 'find-tag adjust for work areas similarly

Basically, look at the path to the tags file (one level above TAGS, see if it matches that of the current file,
and if so, then use that directory.  Added the additional constraint that there must be a TAGS file in the
directory returned, i.e. if the directory calculated does not have a TAGS file, do not return it as a possibility.

This is to help minimize the number of TAGS files loaded by Emacs, b/c in general you're working on one software project
and the TAGS files for each of the sandboxes are about the same.  So just use one TAGS file, but find the files in
the appropriate sandbox."
