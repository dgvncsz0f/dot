;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `thingatpt.el'
;;              have been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `form-at-point'            - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `list-at-point'            - Better behavior.
;;                               Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `symbol-at-point'          - Added optional argument NON-NIL.
;;  `thing-at-point'           - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;
;;
;;  A reminder (the doc strings are not so good):
;;
;;    These functions, defined in `thingatpt.el', all move point:
;;      `beginning-of-thing', `end-of-sexp', `end-of-thing',
;;      `forward-symbol', `forward-thing'.
;;
;;  For older Emacs releases that do not have these functions, they
;;  are defined here as no-ops:
;;
;;  `constrain-to-field', `field-beginning', `field-end'.
;;
;;
;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `thingatpt.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load "thingatpt" '(require 'thingatpt+))

;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2011/09/06 dadams
;;     thing/form-nearest-point-with-bounds: If only one line then do not try to access others.
;;     bounds-of-thing-at-point-1, thing-at-point, thing/form-nearest-point-with-bounds:
;;       Respect field boundaries.
;;     Define constrain-to-field, field-(beginning|end) as no-ops for older Emacs releases.
;; 2011/08/30 dadams
;;     Added: region-or-non-nil-symbol-name-nearest-point.
;;     region-or-*: Use region only if transient-mark-mode, non-empty (and active).
;; 2011/08/17 dadams
;;     list-at/nearest-point-with-bounds:
;;       Don't count `foo or 'foo as a list, i.e., (` foo) or (quote foo).
;; 2011/08/14 dadams
;;     bounds-of-thing-at-point-1:
;;       Tests for end need to use <, not <=.  If past the THING then should return nil.
;; 2011/07/08 dadams
;;     Removed: list-at/nearest-point.
;;     Added: (list|sexp)-(at|nearest)-point-with-bounds,
;;            bounds-of-(list|sexp)-(at|nearest)-point, list-at/nearest-point-with-bounds.
;;     (unquoted-)list-(at|nearest)-point(-as-string):
;;       Redefined using list-(at|nearest)-point-with-bounds.
;;     (put 'list 'bounds-of-thing-at-point 'bounds-of-list-at-point) - not nil.
;; 2011/05/24 dadams
;;     Added: (bounds-of-)string-at-point, string-nearest-point.
;; 2011/05/21 dadams
;;     bounds-of-thing-at-point-1: Synchronized with vanilla Emacs fix for bug #8667.
;; 2011/05/13 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of bounds-of-thing-at-point - fixed bug #8667.
;;       Removed old-bounds-of-thing-at-point.  Added: bounds-of-thing-at-point-1.
;;     Added: forward-whitespace-&-newlines.
;;     Added (put 'thing-at-point *) for unquoted-list, non-nil-symbol-name.
;;     Removed old eval-when-compile for Emacs before Emacs 20.
;; 2011/05/07 dadams
;;     Added: number-at-point-(decimal|hex) and aliases.
;;     Put (bounds-of-)thing-at-point properties: (hex-|decimal-)number-at-point.
;; 2011/05/05 dadams
;;     (put 'list 'bounds-of-thing-at-point nil)  See Emacs bug #8628.
;;     (put 'list 'thing-at-point 'list-at-point) - not really needed, though.
;;     bounds-of-thing-at-point: Mention in doc string that pre-Emacs 23 is buggy.
;; 2011/01/20 dadams
;;     *list-*-point: Improved doc strings.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Removed autoload cookies from non def* sexps and non-interactive fns.
;;     Added autoload cookies for defcustom.
;; 2010/12/17 dadams
;;     Added: (unquoted-)list-(at|nearest)-point, list-at/nearest-point,
;;            unquoted-list-nearest-point-as-string.
;;     list-nearest-point: Redefined using list-at/nearest-point.
;; 2010/12/10 dadams
;;     form-at-point-with-bounds:
;;       Moved condition-case to around whole.  Let sexp be any format of nil.
;; 2010/01/24 dadams
;;     Added: region-or-word-nearest-point.
;; 2008/10/22 dadams
;;     Added: region-or-word-at-point.  Thx to Richard Riley.
;; 2007/07/15 dadams
;;     Added: thing/form-nearest-point-with-bounds,
;;            non-nil-symbol(-name)-(at|nearest)-point, near-point-(x|y)-distance.
;;     (thing|form)-nearest-point-with-bounds:
;;       Use thing/form-nearest-point-with-bounds, which: (1) accepts PRED arg,
;;         (2) respects near-point-(x|y)-distance, (3) fixed some logic.
;;     form-at-point-with-bounds:
;;       Distinguish between nil (no find) and "nil" object found.
;;     (bounds-of-)symbol-(at|nearest)-point(-with-bounds), :
;;       Added optional non-nil arg.
;;     Added beginning-op, end-op, and forward-op for defun type.
;; 2006/12/08 dadams
;;     Added: find-fn-or-var-nearest-point.
;; 2006/05/16 dadams
;;     Only require cl (at compile time) for Emacs < 20.
;;     Replace incf by setq...1+.
;; 2005/12/17 dadams

;; 1996/06/11 dadams
;;     bounds-of-symbol-at-point, bounds-of-symbol-nearest-point,
;;       symbol-at-point, symbol-at-point-with-bounds,
;;       symbol-name-nearest-point, symbol-nearest-point,
;;       symbol-nearest-point-with-bounds: No longer use a syntax-table
;;       arg.  Always dealing with elisp symbols, so use
;;       emacs-lisp-mode-syntax-table.
;; 1996/03/20 dadams
;;     1. Added redefinitions of thing-at-point, form-at-point, with optional
;;        syntax table arg.
;;     2. Added: thing-nearest-point-with-bounds,
;;        bounds-of-thing-nearest-point, thing-nearest-point,

;;        bounds-of-symbol-nearest-point, symbol-nearest-point,
;;        symbol-name-nearest-point: New arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;; 1996/03/08 dadams
